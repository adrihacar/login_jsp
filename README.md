# Secure Login

This program is intended to show how a dynamic web site hosted in a Tomcat Server can interact with a MySQL database 


## Warning :exclamation:

Not implement this login in a real server. This login tries to highlight the concepts of interaction website-database and hashing-salting. It doesn't provide a cookie service to keep track of the user while in the website and is still vulnerable to attacks as SQL Injection.
